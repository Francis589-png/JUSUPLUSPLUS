# Archived: Unreal plugin

The Unreal plugin has been archived to prioritize core language development and the imminent publishing of the language runtime.

Files were moved into `archive/unreal_plugin/` and Unreal-specific CI workflows were removed from `.github/workflows/` in branch `remove-unreal-plugin`.

If you want to restore this work later, a branch and commits are available at `origin/remove-unreal-plugin` (or see the commit where this change was made). The plugin can be reintroduced and its tests/workflows re-enabled when the project is ready to resume Unreal integration.
