See the `syllabus.md` for lesson-by-lesson breakdown and the course folders under `/course` for lesson content, exercises, and solutions.

Notebooks: interactive notebooks for key lessons are in `course/notebooks/` (Lesson 01, Lesson 02, Lesson 06, Lesson 11, Lesson 12, Lesson 16). The CI runs these notebooks to ensure they execute cleanly (see `.github/workflows/course-notebooks.yml`).

A rendered HTML version of notebooks is also produced (by `course/tools/render_notebooks.py`) in `docs/course/notebooks_html/` and the `Course Notebooks` workflow uploads rendered HTML as build artifacts for quick inspection.

Quick start:
1. Read `docs/course/syllabus.md`.
2. Start at `course/beginner/lesson-01-intro.md`.
3. Run examples in `examples/` and follow exercises in each lesson.
